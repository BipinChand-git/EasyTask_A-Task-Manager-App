# Essentials

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.5.

## EasyTask - Enterprise-Level Task Management App

A scalable Angular-based task management application designed for efficient enterprise workflow handling. EasyTask is a great starting point for learning Angular while building something practical.

## Features  

- **Dynamic User Selection** – Choose a user to view personalized tasks.  
- **Task Filtering** – Users' assigned tasks are displayed dynamically.  
- **Standalone Angular Components** – Modular architecture for scalability.  
- **Modern Control Flow** – Utilizes `@for` and `@if` for cleaner template logic.  

## Usage

- Select a user to view their assigned tasks.
- Future enhancements will include task addition and management functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 17+
- TypeScript
- Standalone Components
- Signals API
- Control Flow Syntax (@for, @if)

## Future Improvements

- Implement authentication & role-based access.
- Database integration for persistent data.
- Task addition/edit functionality.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
